We had always said around 28th, \\n29th of January . We had said that in the core businesses the CAPEX will continue. There is \\nabsolutely no reason for any of that to ha ppen. That whole frenzy of half -baked articles and \\nstories were related to people’s perception rather than what we had actually said.

    "### How to Share Prompts on LangChain Hub:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Getting Started:**\n",
    "   - Getting prompts from LangChain Hub is easy, and so is sharing your own prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This lets you easily share and manage your own prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Making a Prompt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - First, create a prompt that fits what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Make sure it follows the rules of LangChain Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sharing Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The sharing has two important parts:\n",
    "     - **Account Handle:** Your special name in LangChain Hub, like `me-langchain-user`.\n",
    "     - **Prompt Name:** A clear name for your prompt, showing what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How to Share with Code:**\n",
    "   - This is a simple way to share:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from langchain import hub\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Define your prompt\n",
    "     my_prompt = \"...\"  # Your prompt content goes here\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Share it on LangChain Hub\n",
    "     hub.push(f\"{account_handle}/{prompt_name}\", my_prompt)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - Replace `account_handle` with your username and `my_prompt` with your prompt's name.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - Make sure `my_prompt` follows LangChain PromptTemplate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using Your Shared Prompt:**\n",
    "   - Once it's shared, you can use it in different apps through LangChain Hub.\n",
    "   - This makes it easy to share with others, work together, and manage your prompts."
